- Proper swing mechanics
- Appropriate warm-up

### Golf Elbow (Medial Epicondylitis)

**Causes:**
- Repetitive gripping and swinging
- Poor technique
- Inadequate forearm strength
- Hitting ground/fat shots

**Prevention:**
- Proper grip pressure
- Swing technique refinement
- Forearm strengthening
- Gradual practice progression

### Rotator Cuff Injuries

**Causes:**
- Repetitive overhead motion (especially lead shoulder)
- Poor mechanics
- Inadequate shoulder strength
- Lack of scapular stability

**Prevention:**
- Shoulder strengthening
- Proper swing sequence
- Scapular stabilization
- Flexibility work

### Wrist Injuries

**Causes:**
- Impact forces

## Golf-Specific Conditioning

### Core Strength (Essential!)

**Rotational Exercises:**

- Russian twists
- Rotational planks

**Anti-Rotation:**
- Pallof press
- Dead bugs
- Bird dogs
- Side planks

**Frequency:** 3-4 times per week, year-round

### Hip Mobility

**Key Exercises:**
- 90/90 hip stretches
- Hip flexor stretches
- Hip rotations
- Pigeon pose
- Figure-4 stretch

**Importance:**
- Allows proper hip turn
- Reduces back stress
- Improves power generation
- Better swing mechanics

### Shoulder Strength and Mobility

**Strengthening:**
- External rotation exercises
- Scapular retraction
- Rows (all variations)
- Overhead press

**Mobility:**
- Sleeper stretch
- Cross-body stretch
- Shoulder circles
- Thoracic spine rotation

### Wrist and Forearm

**Strengthening:**
- Wrist curls (flexion/extension)
- Grip strengthening
- Pronation/supination
- Finger exercises

## Proper Warm-Up Routine

### Pre-Round (15-20 Minutes)

**General Warm-Up (5 minutes):**
- Light cardio (walk, bike)
- Increase heart rate and blood flow

**Dynamic Stretching (5-7 minutes):**
- Arm circles
- Torso rotations
- Leg swings
- Walking lunges with rotation
- Hip circles

**Golf-Specific (5-8 minutes):**
- Practice swings (start slow)
- Gradual club progression (wedges to driver)
- Both full swings and short game
- Increase speed gradually

**Never Skip:**
- Prevents injury
- Improves performance
- Better early-round scores

## Swing Mechanics

### Proper Setup

**Posture:**
- Neutral spine
- Bend from hips (not back)
- Slight knee flex
- Weight balanced

**Grip:**
- Neutral grip (most players)
- Not too tight (light pressure)
- Proper hand placement

### Backswing

**Key Points:**
- Shoulder turn, not just arms
- Maintain spine angle
- Load into trail hip
- Full hip and shoulder rotation

### Downswing and Impact

**Sequence:**
- Hips lead
- Torso follows
- Arms and club last
- Proper weight transfer

**Common Faults:**
- Early extension (standing up)
- Reverse spine angle
- Over-the-top move
- Loss of posture

### Follow-Through

**Finish Position:**
- Balanced on lead leg
- Full rotation
- Chest facing target
- No back pain

## Practice Strategies

### Volume Management

**Avoid Overuse:**
- Limit consecutive days
- Vary practice intensity
- Mix full swings with short game
- Quality over quantity

**Reasonable Limits:**
- Recreational: 100-150 balls per session
- Practice breaks every 20-30 balls
- Hitting mats harder on body than grass

### Equipment Considerations

**Club Fitting:**
- Professional fitting recommended
- Proper club length
- Appropriate lie angle
- Correct shaft flex

**Footwear:**
