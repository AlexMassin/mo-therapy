Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders affect millions of people, causing jaw pain, headaches, and difficulty eating or speaking. If you're experiencing jaw pain, clicking, or limited movement, you're not aloneâ€”and there are effective treatments available.

## Understanding TMJ Disorders

The temporomandibular joint connects your jawbone to your skull, acting like a sliding hinge. TMJ disorders can affect the joint itself, the surrounding muscles, or both.

### Common Symptoms

**Jaw-Related:**
- Pain or tenderness in jaw
- Clicking or popping sounds
- Difficulty opening mouth wide
- Jaw locking (open or closed)
- Uneven jaw movement

**Associated Symptoms:**
- Headaches (especially temples)
- Ear pain or fullness
- Neck and shoulder pain
- Facial pain
- Tooth pain
- Difficulty chewing

### Causes and Risk Factors

**Physical Factors:**
- Jaw injury or trauma
- Teeth grinding (bruxism)
- Arthritis in the joint
- Disc displacement
- Poor posture (especially forward head)
- Dental malocclusion

**Lifestyle Factors:**
- Stress and anxiety
- Poor sleep
- Nail biting
- Gum chewing
- Clenching habits
- Hard/chewy food diet

## Conservative Treatment Approaches

### Self-Care Strategies

**Rest the Jaw:**

### Dental Interventions
