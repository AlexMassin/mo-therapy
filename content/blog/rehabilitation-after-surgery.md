Surgery is only half the battle. Post-surgical rehabilitation is crucial for achieving the best possible outcome, preventing complications, and returning to your desired activity level. Whether you've had joint replacement, ligament reconstruction, or another orthopedic procedure, proper physiotherapy is essential.

## Why Post-Surgical Rehabilitation Matters

### Benefits of Proper Rehabilitation

- **Faster Recovery**: Structured programs speed healing
- **Better Outcomes**: Improves final function and mobility
- **Pain Management**: Reduces reliance on medication
- **Prevents Complications**: Reduces stiffness, weakness, scar tissue
- **Confidence Building**: Gradual progression reduces fear
- **Long-Term Success**: Prevents future problems

### Consequences of Skipping Rehabilitation

- Prolonged recovery time
- Persistent pain and stiffness
- Muscle weakness and atrophy
- Compensatory movement patterns
- Increased risk of re-injury
- Suboptimal surgical outcome
- Possible need for revision surgery

## General Post-Surgical Timeline
