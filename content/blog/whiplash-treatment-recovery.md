Whiplash injuries affect thousands of Canadians annually, primarily from motor vehicle accidents. While most people recover fully, proper treatment and rehabilitation are essential to prevent chronic pain and long-term complications.

## Understanding Whiplash

Whiplash occurs when the head is suddenly jerked forward and backward (or side-to-side), straining the soft tissues of the neck. Despite the violent mechanism, many whiplash injuries heal completely with appropriate care.

### What Gets Injured

- Neck muscles and ligaments
- Facet joints in cervical spine
- Intervertebral discs
- Nerve roots (in some cases)
- Supporting soft tissues

### Symptoms

**Immediate (within 24 hours):**
- Neck pain and stiffness
- Reduced range of motion
- Headaches (base of skull)
- Shoulder and upper back pain

**Delayed (24-72 hours):**
- Dizziness
- Jaw pain (TMJ)
- Arm pain or tingling
- Fatigue
- Difficulty concentrating
- Sleep disturbances

## Severity Grading

**Grade I:** Neck pain, stiffness, tenderness only
**Grade II:** Neck symptoms + musculoskeletal signs (reduced ROM, point tenderness)
**Grade III:** Neck symptoms + neurological signs (numbness, weakness, reduced reflexes)
**Grade IV:** Neck symptoms + fracture or dislocation

Grades III and IV require immediate medical attention.

## Initial Treatment (First 72 Hours)

### What TO Do

**Stay Active:**
- Gentle movement is crucial
- Avoid prolonged bed rest
- Return to normal activities as tolerated
- Short rest periods okay

**Ice Therapy:**
- First 48-72 hours
- 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours
- Reduces inflammation
- Pain relief

**Pain Management:**
- Over-the-counter pain relievers
- As recommended by doctor
- Short-term use
- Avoid opioids if possible

**Gentle Movement:**
- Slow, comfortable neck movements
- Within pain-free range
- Little and often
- Prevents stiffness

### What NOT To Do

**Avoid Soft Collars:**
- Prolonged use weakens muscles
- Increases recovery time
- Only if prescribed by doctor
- Wean off quickly

**Don't Stay Immobile:**
- Complete rest delays recovery
- Muscles become weak
- Stiffness worsens
- Prolongs symptoms

## Physiotherapy Treatment

### Assessment

**Comprehensive Evaluation:**
