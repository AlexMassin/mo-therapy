Arthritis affects over 6 million Canadians, but it doesn't have to control your life. With proper exercise, treatment, and lifestyle management, you can reduce pain, maintain function, and stay active despite arthritis.

## Understanding Arthritis

### Types of Arthritis

**Osteoarthritis (OA):**
- "Wear and tear" arthritis
- Cartilage breakdown
- Most common type
- Typically affects knees, hips, hands, spine
- Worsens with age

**Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):**
- Autoimmune condition
- Inflames joint lining
- Can affect multiple joints
- Systemic symptoms
- Requires medical management

**Other Types:**
- Psoriatic arthritis
- Ankylosing spondylitis
- Gout
- Post-traumatic arthritis

### Common Symptoms

**Pain:**
- Aching, deep joint pain
- Worse with activity (OA) or rest (RA)
- Variable intensity
- May interfere with sleep

**Stiffness:**
- Morning stiffness (worse in RA)
- After prolonged sitting
- "Gelling" phenomenon
- Improves with gentle movement

**Swelling:**
- Joint inflammation
- Warmth and redness
- Limited range of motion
- Feels "tight"

**Reduced Function:**
- Difficulty with stairs
- Trouble opening jars
- Decreased grip strength
- Limited mobility

## Benefits of Exercise for Arthritis

### Why Exercise Helps

Despite pain, exercise is crucial because it:

**Reduces Pain:**
- Strengthens supporting muscles
- Improves joint stability
- Releases natural pain-killers (endorphins)
- Better than medication alone

**Maintains Mobility:**
- Preserves range of motion
- Prevents stiffness
- Maintains function
- Independence in daily activities

**Protects Joints:**
- Strong muscles reduce joint stress
- Better shock absorption
- Improved biomechanics
- Slows progression

**Overall Health:**
- Weight management
- Heart health
- Mood improvement
- Better sleep

### Overcoming Exercise Barriers

**Common Concerns:**
- "Exercise will damage my joints" - FALSE
- "I'm too old to start" - FALSE
- "Pain means I should stop" - Depends on pain type
- "I can't afford it" - Many free options

## Safe Exercise Guidelines

### Exercise Principles

**Start Low, Go Slow:**
- Begin with gentle activities
- Gradual progression
- Consistency more important than intensity
- Listen to your body

**The 2-Hour Pain Rule:**
- Some discomfort during exercise is okay
- Pain should not last >2 hours after
- If it does, reduce intensity next time
- Mild muscle soreness is normal

**Warm-Up and Cool-Down:**
- Essential for arthritis
- Increases synovial fluid
- Prepares joints for movement
- Reduces injury risk

### Types of Exercise

**Range of Motion (Daily):**
- Gentle joint movements
- Through full, comfortable range
- Reduces stiffness
- Maintains flexibility

**Strengthening (2-3x/week):**
- Builds muscle support
- Reduces joint stress
- Improves function
- Use weights, bands, or body weight

**Aerobic/Cardiovascular (Most days):**
- 30 minutes daily (or 10-minute bouts)
- Improves overall health
- Weight management
- Mood enhancement

**Balance Training (2-3x/week):**
- Prevents falls
- Improves confidence
- Functional benefit
- Especially important for older adults
