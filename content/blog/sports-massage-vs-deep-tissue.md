Not all massages are created equal. While both sports massage and deep tissue massage involve applying pressure to muscles, they serve different purposes and use distinct techniques. Understanding these differences helps you choose the right treatment for your specific needs.

### Myth: More pressure equals better results

**Reality:** Appropriate pressure for the tissue and goal is most effective. Sometimes less is more.
