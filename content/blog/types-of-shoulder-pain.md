Shoulder pain is very common and can result in significant loss of function and affect day-to-day activities. The shoulder is one of the most complex joints in the human body, and its intricate structure makes it susceptible to various types of injuries and conditions.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the different types of shoulder pain that people most commonly experience and how our expert team at M.O. Therapy can help you find relief.

## Understanding Your Shoulder Anatomy

Before diving into specific conditions, it's important to understand that your shoulder consists of:

- **Ball-and-socket joint** (glenohumeral joint)
- **Rotator cuff muscles** (four muscles that stabilize the shoulder)
- **Shoulder blade** (scapula)
- **Collarbone** (clavicle)
- **Various ligaments and tendons**

## Common Types of Shoulder Pain

### 1. Rotator Cuff Injuries

**What it is:** The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles and tendons that stabilize your shoulder. Injuries can range from minor strains to complete tears.

**Symptoms:**
- Pain when lifting your arm overhead
- Weakness in the shoulder
- Pain that worsens at night
- Limited range of motion

**Common causes:**
- Repetitive overhead activities
- Age-related wear and tear
- Sudden injury or trauma
- Poor posture

### 2. Shoulder Impingement Syndrome

**What it is:** This occurs when the rotator cuff tendons become compressed between the shoulder blade and upper arm bone.

**Symptoms:**
- Pain when reaching overhead
- Pain that radiates down the arm
- Weakness in the shoulder
- Difficulty sleeping on the affected side

**Risk factors:**
- Repetitive overhead motions
- Poor shoulder mechanics
- Muscle imbalances
- Previous shoulder injuries

### 3. Frozen Shoulder (Adhesive Capsulitis)

**What it is:** A condition characterized by stiffness and reduced range of motion in the shoulder joint, typically progressing through three distinct stages.

**Symptoms:**
- Gradual onset of pain and stiffness
- Significant loss of shoulder movement
- Pain that may worsen at night
- Difficulty with daily activities

**Stages:**
1. **Freezing stage:** Pain increases and range of motion decreases
2. **Frozen stage:** Pain may decrease but stiffness remains severe
3. **Thawing stage:** Range of motion gradually improves

### 4. Shoulder Arthritis

**What it is:** Breakdown of cartilage in the shoulder joint, leading to bone-on-bone contact and inflammation.

**Symptoms:**
- Deep, aching pain in the shoulder
- Stiffness and reduced range of motion
- Grinding or clicking sounds
- Pain that worsens with activity

**Types:**
- **Osteoarthritis:** Wear-and-tear arthritis
- **Rheumatoid arthritis:** Autoimmune condition
- **Post-traumatic arthritis:** Following an injury

### 5. Shoulder Dislocation/Instability

**What it is:** When the upper arm bone comes out of the shoulder socket, either partially (subluxation) or completely (dislocation).

**Symptoms:**
- Intense pain at the time of injury
- Visible deformity of the shoulder
- Inability to move the arm
- Numbness or tingling in the arm

**Risk factors:**
- Contact sports participation
- Previous dislocations
- Genetics
- Ligament laxity
