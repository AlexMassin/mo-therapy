Pelvic floor physiotherapy addresses a range of conditions affecting millions of people, yet many suffer in silence due to embarrassment. This specialized treatment offers effective, non-invasive solutions for pelvic health concerns that significantly impact quality of life.

## Understanding the Pelvic Floor

The pelvic floor is a hammock of muscles, ligaments, and connective tissues that support your pelvic organs (bladder, uterus/prostate, rectum) and control urinary and bowel function.

### Functions
- Supports pelvic organs
- Controls bladder and bowel
- Sexual function
- Core stability
- Breathing assistance

- May not make it to bathroom
- Overactive bladder
- Responds to behavioral strategies + exercise

**Mixed Incontinence:**
- Combination of both types
- Requires comprehensive approach

### Pelvic Organ Prolapse
