Stretching is fundamental to fitness, injury prevention, and overall movement quality. Yet most people stretch incorrectly or at the wrong time. This comprehensive guide will teach you everything you need to know about stretching effectively.

## Types of Stretching

### Static Stretching

**Hold a position for 15-60 seconds**

**Benefits:**
- Increases flexibility
- Reduces muscle tension
- Promotes relaxation
- Simple to perform

**Best Time:**
- After workouts
- Before bed
- Separate flexibility sessions
- When muscles are warm

**NOT Before:** High-intensity or power activities (may reduce performance)

### Dynamic Stretching

**Moving through range of motion repeatedly**

**Benefits:**
- Prepares body for activity
- Increases blood flow
- Improves movement patterns
- Sport-specific preparation

**Best Time:**
- Before workouts
- Warm-up component
- Prior to sports
- Morning routine

**Examples:**
- Leg swings
- Arm circles
- Walking lunges
- High knees
- Torso twists

### PNF Stretching

**Contract-relax technique**

**How It Works:**
- Stretch muscle
- Contract against resistance (6-10 seconds)
- Relax and stretch further
- Most effective for gains

**Best With:** Partner or physiotherapist

### Active Stretching

**Using opposing muscles to create stretch**

**Benefits:**
- Functional flexibility
- Improves muscle control
- Sport-specific
- No equipment needed

**Example:** Lifting leg high and holding with hip flexors (stretches hamstrings)

### Ballistic Stretching

**Bouncing movements**

**Caution:**
- Higher injury risk
- Not for beginners
- Sport-specific uses only
- Requires good base flexibility

## When to Stretch

### Before Exercise (Dynamic Only)

**Why Dynamic:**
- Prepares nervous system
- Increases muscle temperature
- Doesn't impair performance
- Sport-specific movements

**Sample Warm-Up Sequence:**
1. 5-minute light cardio
2. Dynamic stretches (10 minutes):
   - Leg swings (forward/back, side to side)
   - Walking lunges with twist
   - Arm circles
   - Hip circles
   - High knees
   - Butt kicks

### After Exercise (Static)

**Why Post-Workout:**
- Muscles are warm
- Optimal time for flexibility gains
- Aids recovery
- Promotes relaxation

**Hold:**
- 30-60 seconds per stretch
- 2-3 repetitions
- Both sides
- Never to pain

### Separate Flexibility Sessions

**Dedicated Stretching:**
- Warm up first (5-10 minutes light activity)
- Focus on flexibility goals
- Hold stretches longer (60 seconds+)
- 2-3 times per week

## Common Stretching Mistakes

### 1. Stretching Cold Muscles

**Problem:** Increased injury risk

**Solution:** 
- Always warm up first
- 5-10 minutes light activity
- Muscles should feel warm

### 2. Bouncing

**Problem:** 
- Triggers stretch reflex
- Can cause micro-tears
- Counterproductive

**Solution:** 
- Smooth, sustained holds
- Gradual deepening
- Controlled movements

### 3. Holding Breath

**Problem:** 
- Creates tension
- Reduces stretch effectiveness
- Increases discomfort

**Solution:**
- Deep, rhythmic breathing
- Exhale into stretch
- Relaxation focus

### 4. Stretching to Pain

**Problem:**
- Can cause injury
- Triggers protective tension
- Slows progress

**Solution:**
- Stretch to mild discomfort
- "Feels good" sensation
- Progressive approach

### 5. Ignoring One Side

**Problem:**
- Creates imbalances
- Injury risk
- Asymmetry issues

**Solution:**
- Always stretch both sides
- Equal time each side
- Address tighter side first

### 6. Inconsistency

**Problem:**
- Flexibility gains are temporary
- Need regular practice
- Quick to lose

**Solution:**
- Daily practice ideal
- Minimum 3x per week
- Consistency over intensity
