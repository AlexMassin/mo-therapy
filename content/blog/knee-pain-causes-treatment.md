Knee pain is one of the most common complaints we see, affecting people of all ages and activity levels. Understanding the cause of your knee pain is the first step toward effective treatment and prevention of future problems.

## Common Causes of Knee Pain

### Runner's Knee (Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome)

**What It Is:**
- Pain around or behind kneecap
- Most common knee complaint
- Often from overuse or biomechanical issues

**Symptoms:**
- Pain with stairs (especially down)
- Prolonged sitting
- Squatting or kneeling
- Grinding sensation

**Causes:**
- Weak hip/thigh muscles
- Poor foot mechanics
- Tight muscles
- Training errors

**Treatment:**
- Hip and quadriceps strengthening
- Activity modification
- Stretching program
- Proper footwear

### IT Band Syndrome

**What It Is:**
- Inflammation where IT band crosses knee
- Common in runners and cyclists
- Sharp pain on outside of knee

**Symptoms:**
- Pain during activity (especially downhill)
- Worse at specific distance/time
- Swelling on outer knee
- Tenderness to touch

**Causes:**
- Tight IT band
- Weak hip abductors
- Training errors
- Poor biomechanics

**Treatment:**
- Hip strengthening
- IT band stretching
- Foam rolling
- Activity modification
- Gait retraining

### Meniscus Tears

**What It Is:**
- Cartilage tear in knee joint
- Can be traumatic or degenerative
- May lock or catch

**Symptoms:**
- Pain on joint line
- Swelling
- Catching or locking
- Difficulty straightening
- Clicking sounds

**Causes:**
- Twisting injury
- Deep squatting
- Age-related degeneration
- Sports injuries

**Treatment:**
- Conservative first (physiotherapy)
- Rest and activity modification
- Strengthening program
- Surgery if mechanical symptoms persist

### Osteoarthritis

**What It Is:**
- "Wear and tear" arthritis
- Cartilage breakdown
- Progressive condition
- Very common over 50

**Symptoms:**
- Aching pain
- Morning stiffness
- Worse with activity
- Better with rest initially
- Swelling and stiffness

**Treatment:**
- Exercise (most important!)
- Weight management
- Physiotherapy
- Pain management
- Joint replacement (severe cases)

### Ligament Injuries

**ACL/PCL (Cruciates):**
- Major stability ligaments
- Often sports injuries
- May require surgery

**MCL/LCL (Collateral):**
- Side stability ligaments
- Usually heal conservatively
- Graded injuries (1-3)

**Symptoms:**
- Immediate pain
- Swelling
- Instability
- Limited motion

### Tendinopathies

**Patellar Tendinopathy (Jumper's Knee):**
- Pain below kneecap
- Common in jumping sports
- Overuse injury

**Quadriceps Tendinopathy:**
- Pain above kneecap
- Similar to patellar
- Less common

**Treatment:**
- Load management
- Eccentric exercises
- Progressive strengthening
- Patience (12+ weeks)

### Bursitis

**What It Is:**
- Inflammation of bursa (fluid sac)
- Cushions between tissues
- Can swell significantly

**Types:**
- Prepatellar (front of knee)
- Pes anserine (inside, below joint)
- Infrapatellar (below kneecap)

**Treatment:**
- Ice
- Activity modification
- Stretching
- Anti-inflammatory medication
- Rarely needs drainage

## Diagnosis

### Physical Examination

**Assessment Includes:**
- Observation (swelling, alignment)
- Range of motion testing
- Strength assessment
- Special tests (ligaments, meniscus)
- Functional movement analysis
- Gait evaluation

### Imaging

**When Needed:**
- Severe pain or swelling
- Suspected fracture
- Mechanical symptoms (locking)
- No improvement with treatment
- Planning surgery

**Types:**
- X-rays: Bones, arthritis, alignment
- MRI: Soft tissues, ligaments, meniscus
- Ultrasound: Real-time assessment
- CT: Detailed bone imaging (rare)
