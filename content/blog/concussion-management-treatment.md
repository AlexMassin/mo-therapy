Concussions are a form of mild traumatic brain injury that require proper management for complete recovery. With advances in concussion research and treatment protocols, most individuals make full recoveries when following appropriate guidelines.

## Understanding Concussions

### What is a Concussion?

A concussion is a brain injury caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head that disrupts normal brain function. It can also occur from a hit to the body that causes the head to move rapidly.

**Key Points:**
- Functional injury, not structural damage
- Affects brain chemistry temporarily
- No visible changes on standard CT or MRI
- Disrupts neural pathways and communication

### How Concussions Occur

**Sports-Related:**
- Contact sports (hockey, football, rugby)
- Heading the ball in soccer
- Falls during activities
- Collisions between players

**Non-Sports Related:**
- Motor vehicle accidents
- Falls (especially in older adults)
- Workplace injuries
- Assault

### Common Symptoms

**Physical:**
- Headache
- Nausea or vomiting
- Balance problems
- Dizziness
- Visual disturbances
- Sensitivity to light or noise
- Fatigue

**Cognitive:**
- Confusion or feeling "foggy"
- Difficulty concentrating
- Memory problems
- Slowed thinking
- Difficulty with decision-making

**Emotional:**
- Irritability
- Sadness or depression
- Anxiety
- Mood swings
- Emotional sensitivity

**Sleep-Related:**
- Drowsiness
- Sleeping more or less than usual
- Difficulty falling asleep
- Sleep disturbances

## Immediate Management

### On-Field Assessment

**Red Flags - Seek Emergency Care:**
- Loss of consciousness
- Severe or worsening headache
- Repeated vomiting
- Seizures
- Double vision
- Weakness or numbness
- Decreased coordination
- Slurred speech
- Unusual behavior

**Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT5):**
- Standardized sideline assessment
- Memory and orientation testing
- Balance evaluation
- Neurological screen
- Used by medical professionals

### First 24-48 Hours

**Do's:**
- Rest physically and cognitively
- Have someone monitor you
- Ice for headache
- Take acetaminophen if needed (avoid ibuprofen initially)
- Stay hydrated
- Sleep when tired

**Don'ts:**
- Drive
- Drink alcohol
- Use recreational drugs
- Take aspirin or ibuprofen (bleeding risk)
- Return to sport or work
- Use screens excessively

## Diagnosis and Assessment

### Medical Evaluation

**Initial Assessment Includes:**
- Detailed symptom inventory
- Neurological examination
- Cognitive testing
- Balance assessment
- Visual tracking tests
- Neck examination

**Additional Tests May Include:**
- Vestibular/oculomotor screening
- ImPACT or other computerized testing
- Physical examination of neck and spine
- Imaging if structural injury suspected

### Baseline Testing

Athletes should complete baseline testing before season:
- Computerized cognitive assessment
- Balance testing
- Symptom checklist
- Reaction time measures

This provides comparison data if injury occurs.

## Recovery Phases

- Coach and referee training
- Parent education programs

## When to Seek Additional Help

Contact healthcare provider if:

- Symptoms worsen
- New symptoms develop
- Not improving after 2 weeks
- Symptoms return with activity
- Emotional changes persist
- Academic difficulties continue

## Long-Term Considerations

### Multiple Concussions

Each concussion:
- Takes longer to recover
- Increases risk of future concussions
- May have cumulative effects
- Requires more conservative management

**Retirement Considerations:**
- Number and severity of concussions
- Time between injuries
- Age and level of competition
- Personal and family history
- Quality of life impact

### Reducing Future Risk

- Adequate recovery before return
- Strengthening exercises
- Proper technique coaching
- Sport selection consideration
- Honest symptom reporting

## Myths vs. Facts

**Myth:** You must lose consciousness to have a concussion
**Fact:** Most concussions don't involve loss of consciousness

**Myth:** You should wake someone every hour after concussion
**Fact:** Sleep is important for recovery; wake only if advised by medical professional

**Myth:** You can't use screens at all
**Fact:** Limited screen time is often tolerated; listen to your symptoms

**Myth:** All concussions are the same
