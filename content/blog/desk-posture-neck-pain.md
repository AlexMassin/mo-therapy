If you work at a desk, you're at high risk for developing neck and back pain. In fact, office workers are 2-3 times more likely to experience musculoskeletal pain than those in other professions. The culprit? Poor posture and improper ergonomics. But there's good news: with the right setup and habits, you can work pain-free.

## The Cost of Poor Desk Posture

### Common Problems

**Physical Issues:**
- Forward head posture ("tech neck")
- Rounded shoulders
- Upper crossed syndrome
- Lower back pain
- Tight hip flexors
- Weak gluteal muscles
- Headaches and eye strain

**Long-Term Consequences:**
- Chronic pain conditions
- Disc degeneration
- Muscle imbalances
- Reduced lung capacity
- Decreased productivity
- Poor sleep quality
- Reduced quality of life

## Understanding Posture Mechanics

### Ideal Sitting Posture

**From the side:**
- Ears aligned over shoulders
- Shoulders over hips
- Natural spinal curves maintained
- Feet flat on floor

**From the front:**
- Level shoulders
- Symmetrical positioning
- Even weight distribution

### What Goes Wrong

**Forward Head Posture:**
- For every inch forward, adds 10 pounds of stress
- Strains neck muscles
- Compresses cervical discs
- Reduces nerve space

**Rounded Shoulders:**
- Chest muscles tighten
- Upper back muscles weaken
- Shoulder blade dysfunction
- Restricts breathing

**Slouched Lower Back:**
- Increases disc pressure
- Weakens core muscles
- Strains ligaments
- Compresses abdominal organs

## Perfect Desk Ergonomics Setup

### Monitor Position

**Height:**
- Top of screen at or slightly below eye level
- 20-28 inches from eyes
- Directly in front (no twisting)
- Angle tilted 10-20 degrees back

**For Laptop Users:**
- Use external keyboard and mouse
- Elevate laptop on stand
- Never work only on laptop for extended periods

### Chair Setup

**Seat Height:**
- Feet flat on floor
- Knees at 90-degree angle
- Thighs parallel to floor
- 2-4 inch clearance behind knees

**Backrest:**
- Lumbar support at natural curve
- Slight recline (100-110 degrees)
- Full back support
- Adjustable if possible

**Armrests:**
- Support forearms
- Shoulders relaxed
- Elbows at 90 degrees
- Don't shrug to reach them

### Keyboard and Mouse

**Keyboard:**
- Directly in front
- Elbows at sides
- Wrists neutral (not bent)
- Close enough to avoid reaching

**Mouse:**
- Next to keyboard
- Same height
- Arm supported
- Consider ergonomic design

### Desk Height

- Allows 90-degree elbow angle
- Forearms parallel to floor
- No shoulder shrugging
- Consider adjustable-height desk

## Movement is Medicine

### The 20-20-20 Rule

Every 20 minutes:
