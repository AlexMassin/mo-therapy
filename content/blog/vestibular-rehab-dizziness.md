Dizziness and balance disorders affect millions of people, significantly impacting quality of life. Vestibular rehabilitation is a specialized form of physiotherapy that effectively treats these conditions, often providing dramatic improvement where other treatments have failed.

## Understanding the Vestibular System

Your vestibular system, located in your inner ear, works with your eyes and sensory receptors to maintain balance and spatial orientation. When this system malfunctions, you may experience dizziness, vertigo, imbalance, or other troubling symptoms.

### Components

**Inner Ear:**
- Semicircular canals (detect rotation)
- Otolith organs (detect linear movement and gravity)
- Filled with fluid and tiny crystals

**Brain Integration:**
- Processes vestibular information
- Combines with vision and proprioception
- Maintains balance and coordination

## Common Vestibular Disorders

### BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo)

**Most Common Cause of Vertigo:**
- Crystal displacement in inner ear
- Brief spinning with head movements
- Particularly rolling over in bed or looking up
- Very treatable (90% success rate)

**Symptoms:**
- Brief episodes (seconds to minute)
- Triggered by specific head positions
- Spinning sensation
- Nausea
- Usually one-sided

### Vestibular Neuritis/Labyrinthitis

**Inner Ear Inflammation:**
- Often viral origin
- Sudden onset severe vertigo
- Can last days
- Gradual improvement
- May leave residual dizziness

### Chronic Dizziness

**Persistent Unsteadiness:**
- Multiple potential causes
- Often multifactorial
- Impact on daily function
- Requires comprehensive assessment

### Post-Concussion Dizziness

**After Head Injury:**
- May develop immediately or delayed
- Can persist for months
- Often complex presentation
- Requires specialized treatment

## Symptoms of Vestibular Dysfunction

### Dizziness Types

**Vertigo:**
- Spinning sensation
- Room spinning or you spinning
- Often with nausea
- Triggered by movement

**Light-headedness:**
- Feeling faint or woozy
- About to pass out
- Not true spinning
- May have different cause

**Disequilibrium:**
- Off-balance feeling
- Unsteadiness walking
- Like walking on a boat
- Worse in dark or uneven surfaces

### Associated Symptoms

- Nausea and vomiting
- Visual disturbances
- Difficulty concentrating
- Fatigue
- Anxiety
- Headaches
- Motion sensitivity

## Vestibular Assessment

### What to Expect

**Comprehensive Evaluation:**
- Detailed history
- Observation of symptoms
- Positional testing
- Eye movement analysis
- Balance testing
- Gait assessment

### Diagnostic Tests

**Dix-Hallpike Test:**
- Identifies BPPV
- Specific head positioning
- Observes eye movements (nystagmus)
- Determines affected canal

**Head Impulse Test:**
- Tests vestibular reflexes
- Quick head turns
- Eye tracking observed
- Identifies vestibular weakness

**Balance Testing:**
- Standing with eyes closed
- Foam surfaces
- Head turns while standing
- Gait observation

## Treatment Approaches

### For BPPV: Canalith Repositioning

**Epley Maneuver (Posterior Canal):**
- Series of head positions
- Moves crystals out of canal
- Takes 5-10 minutes
- Often resolves in one treatment

**Semont Maneuver:**
- Alternative technique
- Quick position changes
- Similar effectiveness
- Different movement pattern

**BBQ Roll (Horizontal Canal):**
- Series of log rolls
- For horizontal canal BPPV
- Performed on treatment table
- High success rate

**Success Rates:**
- 80-90% resolution in 1-3 treatments
- May need home maneuvers
- Recurrence possible but treatable
- Most dramatic vestibular treatment

### Vestibular Adaptation Exercises

**For Vestibular Hypofunction:**

**Gaze Stabilization:**
- Focus on target while moving head
- Horizontal and vertical movements
- Gradually increase speed
- Reduces dizziness with head movement

**Habituation Exercises:**
- Repeated exposure to provoking movements
- Reduces sensitivity over time
- Individualized to symptoms
- Gradual progression

### Balance Retraining

**Progressive Challenges:**
- Standing exercises
- Walking programs
- Uneven surfaces
- Reduced visual input (eyes closed)
- Dual-task training

**Example Progression:**
1. Standing on firm surface, eyes open
2. Standing on firm surface, eyes closed
3. Standing on foam, eyes open
4. Standing on foam, eyes closed
5. Add head movements to each level

### Substitution Strategies

**Using Other Systems:**
- Vision for balance
- Proprioception enhancement
- Central compensation
- Movement strategies

## Home Exercise Program

### Daily Exercises (As Prescribed)

**Gaze Stabilization:**
- Hold card with "X" at arm's length
- Turn head side to side while keeping eyes on X
- Target stays clear
- 1 minute, 3x daily

**Balance Exercises:**
- Stand on one leg: 30 seconds each
- Tandem stance: 30 seconds
- Walking heel-to-toe: 10 steps
- Progress as able

**Head Movement Exercises:**
- Sitting:
  - Look up and down (10x)
  - Turn side to side (10x)
  - Tilt ear to shoulder (10x)
- Standing:
  - Same movements
  - More challenging

### Progression

**Make Harder By:**
- Closing eyes
- Standing on foam
- Adding head movements
- Dual-tasking
- Uneven surfaces

## Lifestyle Management

### Avoiding Triggers

**Common Triggers:**
- Busy visual environments (grocery stores)
- Crowded places
- Heights
- Escalators
- Moving vehicles
- Fluorescent lights

**Management:**
- Gradual exposure
- Sunglasses if light-sensitive
- Support person initially
- Time exposure carefully

### Fall Prevention

**Safety Measures:**
- Good lighting
- Remove tripping hazards
- Grab bars in bathroom
- Non-slip mats
- Proper footwear
- Assistive device if needed

### Activity Modifications

**During Episodes:**
- Sit or lie down
- Focus on stationary object
- Slow, deep breaths
- Stay calm
- Wait for it to pass

**Daily Life:**
- Move slowly
- Turn body, not just head
- Good lighting
- Clear pathways
- Plan activities

## Recovery Timeline

### BPPV

- Often resolves immediately with treatment
- May need 1-3 sessions
- Some residual unsteadiness 1-2 weeks
- Excellent prognosis

### Vestibular Neuritis

**Acute Phase (Days 1-7):**
- Severe symptoms
- Medication management
- Rest
- Begin gentle exercises

**Recovery Phase (Weeks 2-6):**

- Focus on management and function
- Quality of life improvement possible

## Medications

### Acute Vertigo

**Vestibular Suppressants:**
- Short-term use only (2-3 days)
- Prevents central compensation if used long-term
- Examples: meclizine, dimenhydrinate
- Reduces nausea and vertigo

### Chronic Management

**Usually Avoid Medication:**
- Interferes with adaptation
