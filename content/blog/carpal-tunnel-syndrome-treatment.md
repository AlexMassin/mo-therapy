Carpal tunnel syndrome affects up to 10% of adults, causing pain, numbness, and tingling in the hand and wrist. While surgery is sometimes necessary, many cases respond well to conservative treatment including physiotherapy, splinting, and ergonomic modifications.

## Understanding Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

### What is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?

The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway in the wrist formed by bones and ligament. Through this tunnel passes the median nerve and nine tendons. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) occurs when the median nerve becomes compressed, typically from swelling or repetitive movements.

**The Median Nerve Controls:**
- Sensation in thumb, index, middle, and half of ring finger
- Thumb opposition (ability to touch thumb to fingers)
- Fine motor control of hand

### Symptoms

**Early Symptoms:**
- Tingling or numbness in thumb, index, middle, and half of ring finger
- Symptoms worse at night
- Need to shake hands out for relief
- Intermittent discomfort

**Progressive Symptoms:**
- Constant numbness
- Weakness in grip strength
- Difficulty with fine motor tasks (buttoning, typing)
- Dropping objects
- Thumb muscle wasting (advanced cases)

**Red Flag:** Little finger is NOT typically affected. If it is, the problem likely isn't carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Causes and Risk Factors

**Occupational:**
- Repetitive hand and wrist movements
- Prolonged computer use
- Assembly line work
- Use of vibrating tools
- Awkward wrist positions

**Medical Conditions:**
- Diabetes
- Hypothyroidism
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Pregnancy
- Obesity
- Kidney failure

**Anatomical Factors:**
- Smaller carpal tunnel (genetic)
- Previous wrist fracture
- Wrist arthritis

## Diagnosis

### Clinical Tests

**Phalen's Test:**
- Press backs of hands together
- Hold 60 seconds
- Positive if symptoms reproduced

**Tinel's Sign:**
- Tap over median nerve at wrist
- Positive if tingles shoot into fingers

**Carpal Compression Test:**
- Direct pressure on carpal tunnel
- Positive if symptoms reproduced in 30 seconds

### Diagnostic Studies

**Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS):**
- Measures nerve signal speed
- Gold standard for diagnosis
- Determines severity
- Guides treatment decisions

**Electromyography (EMG):**
- Tests muscle electrical activity
- Assesses muscle damage
- Rules out other conditions

**Ultrasound:**
- Visualizes median nerve
- Shows nerve swelling
- Non-invasive option
- Increasing popularity

## Conservative Treatment Approaches

### 1. Splinting

**Night Splints (Most Important):**
- Maintains neutral wrist position
- Prevents flexion during sleep
- Wear every night for 6-12 weeks
- 80% experience improvement

**Daytime Splinting:**
- During aggravating activities
- Maintains neutral wrist
- Allows some movement
- Use as needed

**Key Points:**
- Wrist in neutral (not bent up or down)
- Thumb free to move
- Comfortable enough to wear consistently
- Custom or over-the-counter options

### 2. Activity Modification

**Work Adjustments:**
- Frequent breaks (every 30 minutes)
- Vary tasks
- Reduce force and repetition
- Use larger muscles for tasks
- Voice-to-text software

**Ergonomic Changes:**
- Neutral wrist position
- Keyboard at proper height
- Wrists not resting on hard edges
- Ergonomic mouse
- Document holder at eye level

**Home Modifications:**
- Tools with larger handles
- Avoid prolonged gripping
- Alternate hands for tasks
- Electric tools vs. manual

### 3. Physiotherapy Exercises

**Nerve Gliding Exercises:**

*Median Nerve Glide:*
1. Start with arm at side, fist closed
2. Extend wrist back
3. Open hand and spread fingers
4. Extend arm out to side
5. Turn palm up
6. Gently tilt head away

Perform slowly, 5-10 repetitions, 3 times daily

**Tendon Gliding Exercises:**
1. Straight position (fingers extended)
2. Hook position (knuckles bent, fingers straight)
3. Fist position
4. Straight fist (fingers bent, thumb out)
5. Full fist (thumb wrapped)

Hold each 3 seconds, 10 repetitions, 3-5 times daily

**Strengthening Exercises:**

*Thumb Opposition:*
- Touch thumb to each fingertip
- 10 repetitions, 3 times daily

*Grip Strengthening:*
- Squeeze soft ball or putty
- Hold 5 seconds
- 10-15 repetitions

*Wrist Extension:*
- Light resistance band
- Extend wrist upward
- 10-15 repetitions

### 4. Manual Therapy

**Techniques:**
- Soft tissue massage (forearm)
- Carpal bone mobilization
- Nerve mobilization
- Myofascial release

**Benefits:**
- Reduces muscle tension
- Improves tissue mobility
- Decreases swelling
- Pain relief

### 5. Modalities

**Ultrasound Therapy:**
- Reduces inflammation
- Promotes healing
- 6-8 sessions typically
- Moderate evidence

**Laser Therapy:**
- Low-level laser
- Reduces pain and inflammation
- Non-invasive
- Growing evidence

**Iontophoresis:**
- Medication delivered through skin
- Anti-inflammatory effect
- Non-invasive alternative to injection

### 6. Corticosteroid Injection

**Considerations:**
- Provides temporary relief (weeks to months)
- Allows participation in therapy
- May avoid surgery in some cases
- 1-2 injections maximum

**Success Rates:**
- 80% initial improvement
- 50% still improved at 1 year
- Best for mild to moderate cases

## Advanced Treatment

### Surgical Release

**When Considered:**
- Failed conservative treatment (3-6 months)
- Severe symptoms
- Muscle wasting
- Constant numbness
- Nerve damage on testing

**Procedure:**
- Open or endoscopic approach
- Cuts transverse carpal ligament
- Releases pressure on nerve
- Outpatient surgery

**Recovery:**
- Immediate: Dressing and elevation
- Week 1-2: Gentle finger movement
- Week 2-4: Light activities
- Month 2-3: Progressive strengthening
- Full recovery: 2-6 months

**Success Rates:**
- 80-90% excellent outcomes
- Symptom relief often immediate
- Numbness may take longer to resolve
- Early treatment = better results

## Prevention Strategies

### Workplace Prevention

**Ergonomic Setup:**
- Keyboard at elbow height
- Mouse close to keyboard
- Wrists in neutral position
- Forearms supported
- Take regular breaks

**Work Techniques:**
- Light touch typing
- Avoid resting wrists on hard surfaces
- Use keyboard shortcuts
- Voice recognition software
- Alternate tasks

### General Prevention

**Risk Reduction:**
- Maintain healthy weight
- Exercise regularly
- Don't smoke
- Manage underlying conditions
- Stay hydrated

**Hand Care:**
- Keep hands warm
- Stretch regularly
