As athletes and active individuals, we push our bodies to perform at their peak. However, with increased activity comes the risk of injury. Understanding the most common sports injuries and implementing proper prevention strategies can help you stay in the game longer and perform better.

## The Top 5 Sports Injuries We See at M.O. Therapy

### 1. Ankle Sprains

**What it is:** Ankle sprains occur when the ligaments supporting the ankle stretch beyond their normal range, often resulting from a sudden twist or roll of the foot.

**Prevention strategies:**
- Incorporate balance and proprioception exercises into your training
- Strengthen the muscles around the ankle, particularly the peroneals
- Wear appropriate footwear for your sport
- Warm up properly before activity

**Key exercise:** Single-leg balance holds on an unstable surface for 30-60 seconds.

### 2. Knee Injuries (ACL/MCL tears, Patellar Tendinopathy)

**What it is:** The knee joint is complex and susceptible to various injuries, from ligament tears to overuse conditions like jumper's knee.

**Prevention strategies:**
- Focus on proper landing mechanics during jumping activities
- Strengthen the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes
- Maintain good hip mobility and stability
- Use proper technique in cutting and pivoting movements

**Key exercise:** Eccentric squats and single-leg deadlifts to build strength and control.

### 3. Shoulder Impingement

**What it is:** This occurs when the rotator cuff tendons become compressed between the bones of the shoulder, leading to pain and reduced range of motion.

**Prevention strategies:**
- Maintain good posture, especially if you have a desk job
- Strengthen the rotator cuff muscles
- Improve thoracic spine mobility
- Address muscle imbalances between chest and back muscles

**Key exercise:** External rotations with resistance bands and thoracic spine extensions.

### 4. Lower Back Strain

**What it is:** Lower back strains involve damage to the muscles, ligaments, or tendons supporting the lumbar spine.

**Prevention strategies:**
- Strengthen your core muscles (not just abs, but all 360 degrees)
- Maintain hip flexibility
- Practice proper lifting techniques
- Gradually increase training intensity

**Key exercise:** Dead bugs and bird dogs for core stability.

### 5. Tennis/Golfer's Elbow

**What it is:** These are overuse injuries affecting the tendons on the outside (tennis elbow) or inside (golfer's elbow) of the elbow.

**Prevention strategies:**
- Use proper technique and equipment
- Gradually increase activity levels
- Strengthen the forearm muscles
- Address shoulder and thoracic spine mobility

**Key exercise:** Eccentric strengthening exercises for the forearm muscles.
