Sciatica affects millions of people every year, causing debilitating pain that radiates from the lower back down through the leg. The good news? Most cases of sciatica respond well to conservative treatment, and you can significantly improve your symptoms with the right approach.

## Understanding Sciatica

### What is Sciatica?

Sciatica refers to pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve, which branches from your lower back through your hips and buttocks and down each leg. Typically, sciatica affects only one side of your body.

### The Sciatic Nerve

- Largest nerve in the body
- Formed from spinal nerves L4-S3
- Travels through the pelvis and down the leg
- Controls muscles in the back of knee and lower leg
- Provides sensation to much of the lower limb

## Common Causes

### Herniated Disc (Most Common)

- Disc material presses on nerve root
- Usually L4-L5 or L5-S1 levels
- Can occur suddenly or gradually
- Often from lifting, twisting, or aging

### Spinal Stenosis

- Narrowing of spinal canal
- More common in people over 60
- Gradual onset
- May involve multiple nerve roots

### Piriformis Syndrome

- Piriformis muscle irritates sciatic nerve
- Deep buttock pain
- Often mistaken for true sciatica
- Responds well to treatment

### Spondylolisthesis

- Vertebra slips forward on another
- Can compress nerve root
- May be degenerative or from injury
- Sometimes requires surgical intervention

### Other Causes

- Spinal tumors (rare)
- Nerve root compression from bone spurs
- Trauma or injury
- Degenerative disc disease
- Pregnancy-related compression

## Symptoms and Diagnosis

### Typical Symptoms

**Pain Characteristics:**
- Radiating from lower back to buttock and down leg
- Sharp, burning, or shooting pain
- Can be constant or intermittent
- Worse with sitting, coughing, or sneezing
- Often only one leg affected

**Associated Symptoms:**
- Numbness or tingling in leg or foot
- Muscle weakness in affected leg
- Foot drop (severe cases)
- Reduced reflexes
- Difficulty moving leg or foot

### Red Flags - Seek Immediate Medical Attention

- Sudden, severe weakness in leg
- Loss of bowel or bladder control
- Numbness in groin area (saddle anesthesia)
- Progressive neurological symptoms
- Severe pain following trauma
- Unexplained weight loss or fever

### Diagnostic Tests

**Physical Examination:**
- Straight leg raise test
- Slump test
- Neurological examination (strength, sensation, reflexes)
- Palpation of muscles and spine
- Range of motion assessment

**Imaging:**
- **X-rays**: Show bone structures, alignment, arthritis
- **MRI**: Best for visualizing discs and nerves
- **CT scan**: Shows bony detail
- **EMG/NCS**: Assesses nerve function (if needed)

## Treatment Approaches That Work

### Phase 1: Acute Pain Management (Days 1-7)

**Goals:**
- Reduce pain and inflammation
- Protect healing tissues
- Maintain some mobility

**Strategies:**

*Activity Modification:*
- Short rest periods (avoid prolonged bed rest)
- Avoid aggravating movements
- Use proper posture
- Frequent position changes

*Ice or Heat:*
- Ice for first 48 hours if acute injury
- Heat after 48 hours for muscle relaxation
- Alternate as needed for comfort
- 15-20 minutes at a time

*Medication:*
- Over-the-counter NSAIDs (if approved by doctor)
- Acetaminophen for pain
- Muscle relaxants if prescribed
- Short-term use only

### Phase 2: Progressive Exercise (Weeks 1-4)

**The McKenzie Method**

Assess your directional preference:

*Extension-Based Exercises (if pain decreases):*
- Prone on elbows
- Prone press-ups
- Standing back extensions

*Flexion-Based Exercises (if pain decreases):*
- Knee to chest stretches
- Cat-cow stretches
- Pelvic tilts

**Important**: Only do exercises that centralize or reduce symptoms. If pain moves further down your leg, stop and consult a professional.
